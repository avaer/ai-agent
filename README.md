This is the core code of the MoeMate AI agent I wrote.

It's not complete code, but should be rasy to port over into your own realtime agent systems.

The `lib` directory contains the main interfaces used to communicate with the backend, as well as the realtime perception driver.

`electron.cjs` contains the core electron driver which reads the screen.
